# DIDComm SDK

This project is a WIP. It is Rust-based DIDComm SDK that enables secure decentralized communication with wallet capabilities and React Native integration.

## 🚨 Learning Project Disclaimer

This project is primarily a learning exercise and personal exploration into decentralized identity and DIDComm protocols. It's built for educational purposes and as a way to understand the fundamentals of:
- DIDComm protocol implementation
- Cryptographic operations in Rust
- Wallet key management
- Cross-platform integration with React Native

**Not Production Ready**: While functional, this SDK is not intended for production use. It serves as a playground for understanding decentralized identity concepts and Rust development.

## Features

- 🔐 Core cryptographic operations (encryption, signatures)
- 📱 Wallet architecture with BIP39 support
- 🔄 DIDComm message handling
- ⚛️ React Native bindings
- 🏗️ Modular and extensible design

## Project Goals

- Learn and implement DIDComm specifications
- Practice Rust development and best practices
- Understand cryptographic primitives
- Explore cross-platform mobile development
- Document the learning journey

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/didcomm-sdk

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Contributing

Feel free to experiment, learn, and contribute! This is a space for learning and exploration.
